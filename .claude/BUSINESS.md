Okay I would like to focus on accelerating the practical AI adoption in business but also include necessary foundations like data platform, architecture and integration. Excuse strategy related services
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî so you want your offering to be hands-on and delivery-oriented, focused on actually getting AI running in production for businesses, while making sure the data foundations are in place. No ‚Äúhigh-level strategy decks‚Äù ‚Äî just build, integrate, and deploy.

Here‚Äôs a service lineup tailored for that:

1. Data Foundations (Build First, Use Immediately)
Modern Data Platform Implementation
Deploy cloud or hybrid platforms (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery) optimised for AI workloads.

Data Architecture & Integration
Design pipelines to bring data from CRMs, ERPs, IoT, or other sources into a unified environment.

Data Quality & Governance Setup
Automate data validation, cleansing, and compliance controls.

Data Warehousing & Lakehouse Solutions
Enable both structured and unstructured data to be ready for AI and analytics.

2. AI Enablement & Acceleration
End-to-End AI/ML Development
Build, train, and deploy models for real-world use cases like forecasting, classification, or anomaly detection.

Generative AI Business Tools
Implement LLM-powered chatbots, document summarisation, and knowledge assistants.

Computer Vision Applications
Deploy AI for visual inspection, object detection, or image categorisation.

ML Ops & Model Deployment
Create automated pipelines for training, testing, and deploying AI models to production.

3. AI-Driven Automation & Integration
Business Process AI Automation
Combine AI with RPA (UiPath, Power Automate) to eliminate repetitive tasks.

AI-Enhanced Enterprise Systems
Embed AI insights into existing tools like Salesforce, SAP, or Microsoft 365.

Custom AI API Development
Build APIs that deliver AI functionality to internal or customer-facing apps.

4. Business Intelligence with AI
AI-Powered Dashboards
Interactive dashboards with embedded predictive models (Power BI, Tableau, Looker).

Natural Language Query Interfaces
Let business users ask data questions in plain language.

Insight Delivery Automation
Automatically generate and send reports when patterns or anomalies are detected.

5. Ongoing AI & Data Operations
Managed AI/ML Services
Monitor model performance, prevent drift, retrain models as needed.

Data Platform Maintenance
Keep data platforms secure, performant, and up-to-date.

Incremental AI Adoption Programs
Introduce new AI features and automation every quarter to continuously improve ROI.

If you want, I can also bundle these into tiered service packages like:

Foundation Tier ‚Üí Set up data platform + pipelines (4‚Äì6 weeks)

Acceleration Tier ‚Üí Add 1‚Äì2 production AI solutions (6‚Äì12 weeks)

Continuous Tier ‚Üí Managed AI + incremental automation (ongoing)

That would make your sales process more frictionless for clients who want fast results but also a path to grow.

Do you want me to draft that tiered ‚ÄúAI Adoption Accelerator‚Äù service model for you? It would make your offer sound more productised and easier to sell.
