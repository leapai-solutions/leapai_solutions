# Service Restructuring Analysis

## Current Challenge
Need to regroup services into 3 big groups, but there's overlap between existing structure.

## Proposed 3-Group Structure
1. **AI Enablement/Foundation** - Build necessary data and AI foundations including platform, dataset etc
2. **AI Acceleration** - The current three tiers
3. **AI Integration** - Connecting AI to existing systems

## Key Issue Identified
**Overlap Problem:**
- **Tier 1 (Foundation 4-6 weeks)** = Data platform, pipelines, storage
- **AI Enablement/Foundation** = Data and AI foundations, platform, dataset

These are essentially the same thing!

## Restructuring Options

### Option 1: Merge and Simplify ⭐ (Recommended)
1. **AI Enablement** (4-6 weeks) - Data platform + AI foundations
2. **AI Acceleration** (6-12 weeks) - Deploy 1-2 production AI solutions  
3. **AI Integration** (Ongoing) - Connect AI to existing systems + continuous improvement

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Eliminates overlap completely
- ✅ Keeps your proven tier structure 
- ✅ Clear progression path for customers
- ✅ Aligns with customer journey: Enable → Accelerate → Integrate

### Option 2: Redefine the Tiers
1. **AI Foundation** - Data platform, architecture, governance
2. **AI Development** - Build and deploy specific AI solutions
3. **AI Integration & Scale** - Connect to systems + expand across organization

### Option 3: Service vs Timeline
- **Services**: Foundation → Development → Integration
- **Engagement Model**: Project-based → Ongoing partnership

## Next Steps
- Think through which approach feels right for the business model
- Consider customer journey and sales process
- Update website services section once decided
- Align navigation and marketing messaging
